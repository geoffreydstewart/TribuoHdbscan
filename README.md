## Measurements and Comparisons of Tribuo Hdbscan, an HDBSCAN* implementation in Tribuo

An implementation of the HDBSCAN* clustering algorithm [1] has been made in Tribuo, the Java machine learning library [Tribuo](https://tribuo.org/). This project contains a set of notebooks which achieve two objectives:

1. Validate the correctness of the implementation's clustering and prediction results.
2. Compare the performance of Tribuo Hdbscan to a [reference Java implementation](http://lapad-web.icmc.usp.br/?portfolio_1=a-handful-of-experiments) and to the [Python module hdbscan](https://hdbscan.readthedocs.io/)

The Tribuo Hdbscan implementation is an ongoing research project, and the code is included in the Tribuo code base. [Tribuo github](https://github.com/geoffreydstewart/tribuo)
